dotfiles
========

dot files: MacOS X but should work with Linux. bashrc, tmux, and vim stuff.

Setup should be pretty bog standard for a Terminal based MacOS X workflow. ctrl-S is used for tmux activities,
so flow control characters (ctrl-q and ctrl-s) are aggressively disabled. tmux is preferred over screen.
